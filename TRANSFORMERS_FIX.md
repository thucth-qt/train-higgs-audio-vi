# Transformers Import Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The error "expected string or bytes-like object" is occurring in the transformers library import process, specifically in:
```
File "transformers/utils/import_utils.py", line 291:
    torch_version = version.parse(_torch_version)
```

This happens when `torch.__version__` is None or not a string, causing the packaging.version.parse() function to fail.

## Root Cause
- PyTorch version string is invalid (None or wrong type)
- This causes transformers library to fail during import
- The issue affects all transformers imports, preventing training from starting

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Emergency Patch (Integrated)
- **Location**: Added to both `trainer/trainer.py` and `validate_setup.py`
- **Method**: Patches `torch.__version__` to a valid string before transformers import
- **Code**:
```python
def patch_torch_version():
    if torch.__version__ is None or not isinstance(torch.__version__, str):
        torch.__version__ = "2.7.1+cu126"  # Use known working version
```

### 2. Diagnostic Tools
- **diagnose_transformers_issue.py**: Comprehensive diagnosis of version compatibility
- **fix_transformers_issue.py**: Automated fix by reinstalling packages
- **patch_transformers.py**: Standalone patch tool

## How It Works
1. **Before any transformers import**, check if `torch.__version__` is valid
2. **If invalid**, patch it to a known working version string
3. **Then proceed** with normal transformers imports
4. **This prevents** the version parsing error that was blocking imports

## Files Modified
- `trainer/trainer.py`: Added patch before transformers import
- `validate_setup.py`: Added patch before transformers import
- Added diagnostic and fix tools

## Expected Result
After rsync, both validation and training should work without the transformers import error. The patch is applied automatically when the scripts run.

## Permanent Fix (Optional)
For a permanent solution, run on the server:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python fix_transformers_issue.py
```

This will update packages to resolve the underlying compatibility issue.
