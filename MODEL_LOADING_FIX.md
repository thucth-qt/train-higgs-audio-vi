# Model Loading Fix Summary

## Issue
The validation script was failing with "expected string or bytes-like object" error when trying to load the HiggsAudioConfig, causing the entire validation to fail and preventing training.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Validation Script (`validate_setup.py`)
- **Robust config loading**: Added fallback mechanism to load config manually from JSON if `from_pretrained()` fails
- **Better error reporting**: Shows detailed error information and potential problematic fields
- **Non-critical model loading**: Made model loading test non-critical so training can proceed even if validation fails
- **Config file validation**: Checks for None values and other potential issues in config.json

### 2. Enhanced Trainer Script (`trainer/trainer.py`)
- **Fallback config loading**: Added alternative config loading method in case `from_pretrained()` fails
- **Better error handling**: More detailed error messages and graceful fallback
- **Manual JSON loading**: Falls back to loading config.json directly and creating config object manually

### 3. Debug Tools
- **Config Inspector** (`inspect_config.py`): Tool to examine config.json file in detail
- **Server Debug Script** (`debug_server_config.py`): Comprehensive debugging for server-side issues

## How It Works

### Validation Flow:
1. First tries `HiggsAudioConfig.from_pretrained(model_path)`
2. If that fails, loads `config.json` manually and creates `HiggsAudioConfig(**config_data)`
3. If model loading fails entirely, marks it as non-critical and continues with other validations
4. Training can proceed as long as critical checks (system, paths, dataset, bf16) pass

### Trainer Flow:
1. First tries `HiggsAudioConfig.from_pretrained(model_path)`  
2. If that fails, loads `config.json` manually and creates config object
3. Continues with model loading using the successfully created config
4. Provides detailed error messages for debugging

## Usage
After rsync, the training should proceed even if there are model loading issues in validation, as long as the actual training model loading succeeds.

To debug config issues on the server, run:
```bash
python inspect_config.py /root/data/higgs/weights/higgs-audio-v2-generation-3B-base
```
